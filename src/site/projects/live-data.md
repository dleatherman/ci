Microwaves, seven minute abs, and *Insta*gram: everything is live and the digital world gives us information right at our fingertips. The internet connects the unconnected through discoverability and feedback as our themes for this class.

Your task is to connect an outside data source, whether dynamic or static, and bring it to life in an interesting and dynamic way. How will you display the data? How will you make it engaging and dynamic? What level of detail do you need to provide to make the data delightful? How abstract or literal will your data be?
