Design can be used to improve our daily lives. If you think about it, everything is designed. Whether it's well-designed or by default, is up for debate, but everything we encounter was made. It could be as simple as a [Norman Door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI), or a better way to wake up, but we will always be looking for opportunities to improve our design, taste, and ability to notice.

Your task is to begin to notice things that are well-designed and poorly-designed in your daily routine. Collect photos of six things that are well-designed, and six poorly-designed, for a total of 12 photos. Make the items you identify are important to your life at this moment. Why are they important? What about them makes them designed? How do they help/hinder performance?

Archive your items in a simple website. It can be a single page or multi-page. The caveat is that youâ€™re not allowed to use type in any way. With this challenge, how can you use strong visuals to direct a user and also communicate a story?

Check [Studio](/studio) or [Lab](/lab) sites for more detailed milestones.
