P5.js is a great way to introduce ourselves to mathematics and the basics of JavaScript. Focusing on user input, you will create a dynamic composition based on touch, click, keys, or some other form of user input. Each composition will be individual and dynamic, but also be downloaded and archived by the user.

- How will you manage the "state" of the canvas?
- How will you educate the user?
- Will you include subtle hints or detailed instructions?
- What form will the composition take?
