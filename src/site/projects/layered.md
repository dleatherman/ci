Consider the human body as a complex network of systems, there are different systems and organs working together to form a larger network of life. Drawing inspiration from [The Powers of 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0) by Charles &amp; Ray Eames, as a way to think about perspective, we'll be exploring complex layered systems working together in context and concert.

Your task is to notice layers (nodes) in systems and how they function individually and together. Using shapes, images, styles, and typography, create a website inspired by layers found in nature or in the created world.
