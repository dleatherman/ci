We have a special invitation extended to our class to attend Creative Mornings on Friday an event for the creative community in NYC. The first half of our class will be directed to the Event starting at 8:30 in the Tishman Auditorium, University Center, 63 Fifth Avenue with Scott Harrison (founder of charity: water). To attend, you'll first need to [fill out this form](https://prmlg.ht/2H4iTyR) and create a [Creative Mornings profile](https://creativemornings.com/)

For attendance you will need to take a selfie in front of a creative mornings sign and email it to me by 12PM on Friday. Please also **physically check in with me on the floor of the auditorium after the presentation and before you leave** so I can confirm your attendance üßê and we will not be meeting for regular class. Again, I expect you to be at the event, take a selfie, and physically check in with me before you leave the auditorium to be counted as attended.
